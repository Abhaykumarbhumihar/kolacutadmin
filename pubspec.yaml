# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Poppins Black
      fonts:
        - asset: images/assets/Poppins-Black.ttf

    - family: Poppins BlackItalic
      fonts:
        - asset: images/assets/Poppins-BlackItalic.ttf

    - family: Poppins Regular
      fonts:
        - asset: images/assets/Poppins-Regular.ttf

    - family: Poppins Light
      fonts:
        - asset: images/assets/Poppins-Light.ttf

    - family: Poppins Medium
      fonts:
        - asset: images/assets/Poppins-Medium.ttf

    - family: Poppins Semibold
      fonts:
        - asset: images/assets/Poppins-SemiBold.ttf
